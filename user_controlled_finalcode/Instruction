This folder contains the matlab code for moving and testing the followong joints:
   1. base
   2. shoulder
   3. elbow
   4. pitch right
   5. pitch left
The gripper cannot be moved using this code. The speed of these joint motors can be controlled by changing the duty cycle in the 
anticlockwise and clockwise functions. However, the speed of pitch_left (and also for the gripper) motor cannot be controlled due 
to wanting of PWM pins in the arduino board.

Run the chk.m, the main code. It will call the necessary functions.
